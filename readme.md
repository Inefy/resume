# Simple Resume

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my resume. The resume is structured using the `extarticle` document class and uses several packages to enhance the layout and design.

## Structure

The resume is divided into several sections:

- Personal Information: This includes my name, location, contact information, and GitHub profile.
- Education: This details my educational background.
- Experience: This section contains my work experience, detailing the roles I've held and my responsibilities.
- Projects: This section highlights some of the projects I've worked on.
- Skills: This section lists my technical and soft skills.

## Compilation

This LaTeX document uses the `fontspec` package, which requires either XeTeX or LuaTeX to work. If you're using a command line interface, you can compile this document by typing `xelatex resume.tex` or `lualatex resume.tex` instead of `pdflatex resume.tex`.

If you're using a LaTeX editor, there should be an option somewhere in the settings to change the compiler to XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.
